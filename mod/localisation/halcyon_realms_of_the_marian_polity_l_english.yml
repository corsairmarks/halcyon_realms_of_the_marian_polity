 origin_early_catalytic_processing_desc: "This civilization's homeworld is unusually rare in common (on the galactic scale) metallic minerals. The dearth of metals lead to early innovation in the use of organic materials as a substitute for metals and alloys. Organic-derived materials are used for practically every application, even continuing through the Space Age."
