 EMPIRE_DESIGN_marian_polity: "Halcyon Realms of the Marian Polity"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_marian_polity_desc: "The Mari are hard-shelled molluscoids hailing from the watery world of Djo Feh'Mari. They evolved shells as protection from the mega-predators of their homeworld. Shells were enough to prevent their extinction, but evolutionary pressures lead the Mari to tool-use as a continuation of their struggle for survival. They constructed of walled enclaves deep below the ocean surface to escape their natural predators.\n\nTheir defensive stance gave them protection to thrive, but lead to increasing pressure for more effective agriculture and aquaculture as their population increased but territories did not. Gradually they were squeezed into tighter and tighter living spaces as all other available, safe space was necessarily converted to feed the masses.\n\nSeeing the inevitable stagnation of their society, several feudal lords began hunting campaigns to purge the predators and claim more territory. Although it took generations of effort and millions of dead Mari, they eventually culled all of their natural predators and entered an age of peace.\n\nWith the whole of Djo Feh'Mari available to their (comparatively) small population, conflict over territory was rare as the Mari spread across the hitherto unlivable seabeds. Their philosophical renaissance began in earnest as the need for violent conflict receded into their cultural past. Philosophers regretted the slaughter of the predatory megafauna - a part of the world had been permanently erased by the tendrils of their civilization.\n\nScientists made many new discoveries about the megafauna, including the possibility that they had also been reasoning, intelligent beings. The Mari found evidence that they effectively forced their predators onto the same path as their own evolution - constant retreat in steadily shrinking territory. Confronted with overwhelming Marian hunting spears and merciless hunters, the predators were afforded no chance to develop much beyond their predatory instincts.\n\nMarian society collectively entered a mourning period for their perceived sins, and culturally rejected violence as a solution. Instead, they turned to their skill in agriculture as a way to cultivate new life and atone for their arrogant past. Centuries slowly rolled forward as the Mari focused on harmony with their world. As they move into the interstellar age, their society is gripped with trepidation over the possibility for contact with other, alien life - recalling all too well the finality of genocide."
